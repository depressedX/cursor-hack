I've made the necessary changes to ensure that the left and right navigation buttons are always sandwiching the content in the middle. Here's a summary of the modifications:

1. Split the \`renderNavigationButtons\` function into two separate functions:
   - \`renderLeftNavigationButton\`
   - \`renderRightNavigationButton\`

2. Modified the main return statement to place these navigation buttons on either side of the central content:

\`\`\`jsx
<div>
  {renderLeftNavigationButton()}
  <Show
    when={!props.isGenerating}
    fallback={renderCancelButton()}
  >
    {/* ... inline diff buttons or file name ... */}
  </Show>
  {renderRightNavigationButton()}
</div>
\`\`\`

This new structure ensures that:
- The left navigation button is always on the left side.
- The right navigation button is always on the right side.
- The cancel button or inline diff buttons (depending on the state) are always in the middle.

This layout maintains the sandwiching effect you were looking for, regardless of whether we're showing the cancel button during generation or the inline diff buttons when not generating.

Is this layout more in line with what you were expecting? Let me know if you need any further adjustments or explanations.`,
